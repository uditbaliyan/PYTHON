In Python, you can perform various mathematical operations using operators. Here are some of the most commonly used mathematical operators:

1. **Addition (+)**: Adds two numbers together.

   ```python
   x = 10
   y = 5
   result = x + y
   print(result)  # Output: 15
   ```

2. **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts one number from another.

   ```python
   x = 10
   y = 5
   result = x - y
   print(result)  # Output: 5
   ```

3. **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two numbers.

   ```python
   x = 10
   y = 5
   result = x * y
   print(result)  # Output: 50
   ```

4. **Division (/)**: Divides one number by another. Note that this operation always returns a float.

   ```python
   x = 10
   y = 5
   result = x / y
   print(result)  # Output: 2.0
   ```

5. **Integer Division (//)**: Divides one number by another, but truncates the decimal part, giving an integer result.

   ```python
   x = 10
   y = 3
   result = x // y
   print(result)  # Output: 3
   ```

6. **Exponentiation (**)**: Raises one number to the power of another.

   ```python
   x = 2
   y = 3
   result = x ** y
   print(result)  # Output: 8
   ```

7. **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of the division of one number by another.

   ```python
   x = 10
   y = 3
   result = x % y
   print(result)  # Output: 1
   ```

8. **Absolute Value (abs())**: Returns the absolute value of a number.

   ```python
   x = -10
   result = abs(x)
   print(result)  # Output: 10
   ```

9. **Round (round())**: Rounds a number to the nearest integer.

   ```python
   x = 3.7
   result = round(x)
   print(result)  # Output: 4
   ```

These are the basic mathematical operations you can perform in Python. They are fundamental for performing calculations in your programs.
