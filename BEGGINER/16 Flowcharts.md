Flowchart programming is a visual representation of an algorithm or a process. It uses standardized symbols and shapes to represent different actions, decisions, and inputs in a program. Flowcharts help in understanding the logic and structure of a program before writing the actual code.

Here are some of the common symbols used in flowchart programming:

1. **Start/End Symbol**:
   - Represents the beginning or end of a process.
   - Usually depicted with an oval shape.

2. **Process Symbol**:
   - Represents a processing step or action.
   - Usually depicted with a rectangle.

3. **Input/Output Symbol**:
   - Represents an input or output operation.
   - Usually depicted with a parallelogram.

4. **Decision Symbol**:
   - Represents a decision point in the process flow.
   - Usually depicted with a diamond shape.
   - It typically involves a yes-or-no question.

5. **Connector Symbol**:
   - Used to connect different parts of a flowchart.
   - It's useful for reducing clutter and making flowcharts more readable.

6. **Flow Lines/Arrows**:
   - Used to show the direction of flow from one step to another.

7. **Loop Symbol**:
   - Represents a loop or repetition in the process flow.
   - It can be a pre-test loop (where the condition is checked before entering) or a post-test loop (where the condition is checked after entering).

8. **Off-Page Connector**:
   - Used to connect different parts of a flowchart that are on separate pages.

9. **Annotation**:
   - A text box or label used to provide additional information or explanation about a specific part of the flowchart.

Flowchart programming is especially useful for:

- Planning and visualizing the logic of a program before writing the actual code.
- Providing a clear and concise representation of a process or algorithm.
- Debugging and troubleshooting existing code by visually tracing the flow of execution.

While flowcharts are a valuable tool for designing algorithms and processes, they are not a programming language themselves. Instead, they serve as a visual aid to help plan and understand the structure of a program before implementation.
